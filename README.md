# Advent-of-code

https://adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

The SNDevs group participates together on the #advent-of-code channel on the [sndevs.com](https://sndevs.com/) server:

# Earl's setup

1. Notice how I set up my [Day 1 Template](https://github.com/earlduque/Advent-of-code/tree/main/Template/Day%201) folder: example files, an input file, a part 1 file, and a part 2 file.
2. Every day of AoC, I copy and paste the example input (as is) into the example file, and the challenge input into the input file (again, as is).
3. The code on the part1 and part2 files, when ran, grabs the text from the example or input file for me to use in my challenge code.
4. I use [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) to execute the code inside VS Code.
5. Any of my `console.log()` statements appear in the ouput window in my VS Code.
